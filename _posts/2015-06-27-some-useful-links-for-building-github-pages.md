###How to get started

Refer to "[一步步在GitHub上创建博客主页](http://www.pchou.info/web-build/2013/01/03/build-github-blog-page-01.html)".

###Categories and tags

I tried the [this](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/) one. It works well.

###Jekyll debugging

I didn't try the [debugger](https://github.com/octopress/debugger) yet.
